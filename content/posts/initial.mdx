Finally starting a blogging website. The goal is to get in the habbit of
capturing learnings and by writing about them. I stand to believe that as a
software engineer, writing is _not_ optional. You have to partake in discussion,
document review and writing.

Shoutout to my friend at [thefake.dev](https://thefake.dev/) who indirectly
inspired me to start blogging.
